- Modify connector-bookshelf to integrate new type of field (same as email/password);

# Tradeoffs

What potential tradeoffs are involved with this proposal.

- Possibly wrong pattern, because all the fields should be seperated.
  Field creation, extending should be seperate logic with it's own env.

- It's part of the core untill strapi will support custom field creation.

# Alternatives

You can create seperate field for sorting, and manage it by incrementing numbers, but for dummy user it could cause more problems than solving it.

# Unresolved questions

- Name of field (personal suggestion - **sorter**)
- Buffet icon ðŸš€
- Maybe sorting should be core functionality without any sort field? (problem - that it will be possible to and it only on creation, like draft system)
- Pattern of creating field types, consider adding support to add custom fields, eg. google map, image map, etc.
