# Summary

Add the option to convert all uploaded images to WebP or AVIF instead of just resizing them.  This would be done via a **opt-in** parameter in `./config/plugins.js`. 

# Motivation

WebP and AVIF are superior formats for the web and support is growing very fast.

It got to a point where some projects could decide to **only** work with these formats to improuve the user experience without adding engeneering complexity or hosting costs.

One could even argue that this could make your service more ecologically friendly, by reducing the data transfered on every page load.

### How much better?

"WebP typically achieves an average of 30% more compression than JPEG" -- [Google WebP FAQ](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/faq#:~:text=WebP%20typically%20achieves%20an%20average,help%20make%20the%20web%20faster.)

### How good is browser support?

As of Agust 2022 of the major browsers that don't support it are:
- WebP: Only IE does not support it
- AVIF: Edge and other smaller browsers don't have support, and Safari desktop has partial support

# Detailed design

This could be done directly in [/packages/core/upload/server/services/image-manipulation.js](https://github.com/strapi/strapi/blob/master/packages/core/upload/server/services/image-manipulation.js) file.

A member of the community already had a prototype (no affiliation):
https://github.com/devgar/strapi/blob/243d914efeebfdb44b236af76689c30b73fed646/packages/strapi-plugin-upload/services/image-manipulation.js

Basically it would instruct `sharp` package to transform to `webp` or `avif`. This would **not** require an aditional dependency, not even a new import in the file.

It will of course still resizes images like before (e.g. `large`, `medium` ...).

These changes being applied only at the upload phase, would not require all the images to be reformatted making it pretty safe for retro-compatibility. And it can be turned on and off without much consequences.

# Example

Something like this:
```ts
// path: ./config/plugins.ts

export default ({ env }) => ({
  upload: {
    config: {
        convertAllImagesTo: 'webp' | 'avif'; // To be defined
    },
  },
});
```

# Tradeoffs

- Even if I'm pretty confident that is a good decision for many of us, it is **opinionated**. This could be mitigated by adding more formats as targets like `png` or `jpeg`.
- I don't know how computer intensive it is to do the transformation.

# Alternatives

I guess this could be done in a plugin. But this would require replacing the official `strapi-plugin-update` for a community one. This plugin is quite big and important, I wouldn't recommend replacing it with a community-maintained plugin.

If is not in the official one, I wouldn't bother doing it.

# Unresolved questions

- Should it support many different formats (e.g. `png` and `jpeg`) or just work with `webp` and `avif` which are the ones that should be used? More formats would make it less opinionated but would add more maintenance, and may not be that relevant.
- How should the `./config/plugins.ts` look like?
